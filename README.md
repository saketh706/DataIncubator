I have analysed the GDELT Dataset by using following search criteria:

Start Date = 01/01/2018
End Date = 07/28/2019
        Actor1 Country: USA
        Actor1 Type: HLH
        Actor2 Country: 
        Actor2 Type: 
        Event Code: 
        Event Quad Class: 
        Event Country: US
        Weighting: NUMEVENTS

This is the visualisation of all the Health issues among United States from January 1, 2018 to July 28,2019.
By observing the heat map we may assume that Eastern parts of the USA have more health issues that other parts.
By further analysis we can find out the root cause of those issues and may also find a way to control those issues.
This will also help in finding which health issues are common among different regions of USA. 
By performing meaningful extractions we can also find the cure of those issues and help out people in different regions.
Like this we can extract some meaningful insights and help our society in some way.
